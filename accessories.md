## Brake Pedals

A dual-height brake pedal raises the pedal height, making it easier to use the
rear brake while standing.

- The F850GSA OEM brake pedal is dual-height, and could possibly be adapted to
the F750GS and F850GS

## Handguards

Handguards provide wind deflection for road riding and protect the rider's
hands when riding off-road.

- [Barkbusters Variable Protection System](https://barkbusters.net/products/vps/) 
- BEWARE that the metal guard interferes with the instrument panel at certain
  angles. In a crash or tip-over, there is a risk that the guard could rotate
and impact the instrument panel.
- The F850GSA comes equipped with handguards which are suitable for wind
  deflection and minor obstacles when riding off-road, but are made of plastic
instead of metal and not suitable for hard knocks.

## Headlight Guard

A headlight guard prevents a rock from smashing your expensive LED headlight (a
real risk when following other vehicles off-road)

- [Puig Headlight Protector](https://puig.tv/en/tuning-motos/headlight-protector/headlight-protector?bike=23755)
- [AltRider Stainless Steel Mesh Headlight Guard](https://www.altrider.com/altrider-stainless-steel-mesh-headlight-guard-for-the-bmw-f-850-750-gs/pid/2747/cid/2)

## Sidestand/Kickstand Foot

A sidestand foot spreads the weight of the bike over a larger area than the OEM
sidestand, which prevents the bike from sinking into soft ground when parked.

- A crushed soda can or hockey puck makes an excellent sidestand foot.
- [Revzilla sells sidestand feet for as low as $5](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle-side-stand-feet)
- [Metal sidestand feet are available on AliExpress for under $10](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32999761042.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.23571245zq4B9v&algo_pvid=53c47799-9548-407d-a04c-0c62b564276c&algo_expid=53c47799-9548-407d-a04c-0c62b564276c-0&btsid=9f609285-a54c-4144-8e96-ee70966496e3&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4,searchweb201603_52)
- In a pinch, put a flat rock under your sidestand to spread the weight out.

## Skid Plate

A skid plate protects the underside of the bike from rocks and debris, and can
be used to slide the bike over obstacles such as tree trunks.
