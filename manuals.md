## Rider's Manual

The rider's manual (aka the owner's manual) covers basic operation of the
motorcycle. Unlike most motorcycle owner's manuals, it does not cover regular
maintenance procedures such as oil and filter changes.

[The rider's manual can be downloaded from BMW's
website.](https://www.bmw-motorrad.com/en/service/manuals/rider-manual.html)

## Repair Manual

The Repair Manual covers maintenance and repair of the motorcycle.

The Repair Manual is available through the parts desk at a BMW dealership
as a DVD for about $120. It is a DVD containing a Windows application with
a serial activation key. The software can be activated an unlimited number
of times.
