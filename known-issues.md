# Known Issues

## RDC (tire pressure monitoring system) displays incorrect values

The RDC system displays the correct tire pressures. This has led the system to
being nicknamed "Rarely Displays Correct."

Recommended action: Carry a reliable tire pressure gauge and regularly check
tire pressure.

## Brake lever is difficult to reach while standing

The stock brake lever is positioned too low to be easily reached from a
standing position, as one would do when riding off-road.

It is not recommened to attempt to adjust the brake lever to compensate. There
is very little adjustable clearance, and a setting which allows the tire to
spin freely on the center stand will cause the brakes to rub, overheat and lock
up while riding. I have personally locked up my own brake after attempting to
adjust the lever to my preferred position. Another customer of my dealership
also did the same thing- except their brake line failed under the pressure and
they started shooting flaming brake fluid out of their brake line during an
organized ride event.

Recommended actions:

- Install the the dual-height brake lever from an F850GSA.
- Install an aftermarket dual-height brake lever, such as an AltRider
  DualControl.
- Install aftermarket footpegs, such as PivotPegz or Touratech Works footpegs

## Clutch Overheats in Traffic/Slow Riding Conditions

The clutch can rapidly overheat in slow-moving/stop and go traffic and other
slow riding conditions. The clutch lever will become very loose and shifting
will become difficult.

Recommended actions:

- Avoid dense traffic
- Lane split/lane filter in dense traffic (if legal in your area)
- Avoid riding the clutch when riding at low speeds
- If clutch overheats, pull over safely and turn the engine off. Allow bike to
  cool down a bit and then adjust clutch lever as necessary. Remember to loosen
clutch lever when parking at your destination to avoid overtensioning the cable
when the bike is fully cooled.
