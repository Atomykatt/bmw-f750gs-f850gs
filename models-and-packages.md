# Variants

There are three models of the F750GS/F850GS:

- The **F750GS**, which is slightly less powerful and is more focused on
  on-road riding
- The **F850GS**, which is slightly more powerful and is more focused on
  off-road riding
- The **F850GS Adventure** (aka the GSA), which is an even more off-road
  focused F850GS

All versions of the bike share the same frame and the same 853cc engine block.
Many of the parts are the same across the models as well.

In addition, there are four "optional" packages available:

- Comfort
- Touring
- Dynamic
- Lighting

As of 2019, virtually all bikes imported into the US were equipped with all of
the optional packages available. According to my local dealership, there is
very low demand for bikes without all options.

## Models

### F750GS

- A different camshaft, intake and engine map are used from the F850GS. This
  lowers power to 77hp/61ft-lb. This accomodates a governer to further reduce
power to comply with European A2 license restrictions, making the F750GS
suitable for less experienced European riders.
- The F750GS has cast aluminum alloy wheels, with a 19 inch front wheel. This
  improves on-road handling at the expense of off-road obstacle clearance and
durability.
- The front suspension is a conventional (right-side up) 41mm fork with 5.9 inches
  of travel.
- The rear shock is a conventional spring strut shock with 6.9 inches of
  travel.
- Due to the lower suspension, seat height is 0.2 inches lower on the F750GS.
- Total ground clearance is 7.5 inches.
- The F750GS is 493lbs wet.

### F850GS

- The F850GS outputs 90hp/63ft-lb.
- Spoked wheels are used, with a 21-inch wheel in front. This improves off-road
  obstacle clearance and durability, and provides a wider range of off-road
tire choices.
- The front suspension is an inverted (upside-down) 43mm fork with 8.0 inches
  of suspension travel.
- The rear suspension is a progressive-damping spring strut with 8.6 inches of
  travel.
- Total ground clearance is 9.8 inches.
- The F850GS is 504lbs wet.

The F850GSA includes all features of the F850GS, plus the following:

- Larger fuel tank
- Taller windshield
- OEM engine crash bars

There are additional features on the Adventure, but the bike is not well
documented online.
